# Predicting-Hypertension
This repository contains the data files, notebooks, reports and presentation for producing a model to predict hypertension using health survey data.

An explanation of the coded values for the features in the dataset is provided in NHIH Codebook.pdf.

When running the notebooks, the files Extract9ColMapping.csv and nhis_00010.csv need to be in the working directory.
